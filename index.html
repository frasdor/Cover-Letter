                    <h2 class="header-primary">Dear Comarch Recruitment Team,</h2>
                    <p class="description">
                        I would like to apply for the programming internship at Comarch. I am eager to use my programming skills in real projects and learn from experienced professionals. This internship is a great opportunity for me to gain valuable experience and grow in the IT field.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">
                        I recently completed an intensive Full-Stack Development course, where I learned the basics of JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, and database management. During my studies, I worked on several projects, including a contact management application with user authentication and a movie search app using an external API. Even though I have experience in both front-end and back-end technologies, I am especially interested in improving my JavaScript skills and learning good programming practices.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">
                        My strengths as a candidate are my strong work ethic, problem-solving skills, and ability to learn quickly. I enjoy working in a team and taking on challenges that help me grow. Currently, I am participating in the TechLeaders mentoring program, where I work 1:1 with a mentor on an e-commerce project focusing on payment processing and database management. This allows me to gain hands-on experience and improve my skills under expert guidance.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">
                        I am excited about the opportunity to work on real projects, collaborate with experienced teams, and learn more about software development at Comarch. I believe this internship will help me build a strong foundation for my future career, and I would be happy to join your team.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">
                        Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my participation in the internship program.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">
                        Best regards,
