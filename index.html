                    <p class="description">
                        I was interested in the job offer for the Fullstack Developer position at Incubly. I am currently participating in the TechLeaders mentoring program, where I am developing an e-commerce project under the guidance of a mentor. I quickly adapt to new technologies and strive to apply my knowledge effectively in practice.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">
                        I have completed an intensive Full Stack Developer course, focusing on Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. One of the projects I worked on was an email verification system for user registration, where I integrated the SendGrid API. In another project—a contact book application—I handled user authentication using JWT and developed the API.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">
                        Although I am at the beginning of my journey as a Fullstack Developer, I am fully committed to the tasks I take on and consistently work towards their completion. I am eager to take on new challenges to develop my skills and gain practical experience. If you see any opportunity for collaboration—even in a different capacity—I would be happy to discuss how I could contribute to the Incubly team.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">
                        Thank you for your time, and I look forward to further contact.
                    </p>
                    <p class="description">
                        Best regards,
                    </p>
